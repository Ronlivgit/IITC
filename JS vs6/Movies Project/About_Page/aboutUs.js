//? guidelines for the project -
// -------------------------------- \\
//! (1-home page) use class collection for the pagination (changing movies with btns 1-5), 
//? using for loop to go through page's nums to find the user's movie name(?)
//! (1-home page) fetch data of popular (weekly+daily) through the site, change page based of btn presses.
//! (2-single movie page) override the previous movie with the newly valued input.
//! (3- about us page) about page = info about us (devs).
//! (4-search page) similar to the first page (design-wise and function-wise),display all results OF THE MOVIE SERIES
//! (5-favourite page) a page that will show the user's chosen movies from other pages (use array to push general wide info display with <list>)
//! Extra - solo learning it.
